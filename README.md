# NBA Playoffs Simulation Project

Hello! Welcome to my NBA Playoffs Simulation Engine! Download the zip file and you're good to go! In this simulation, you have the option of either simulation a whole NBA Playoff's with randomly generated teams, or generating a playoff series between any two teams in the NBA. Make sure you "pip3 install openpyxl", "pip3 install tabulate", "pip3 install random", and "pip3 install time" in the terminal or command line. Then, simply run the code and you're good to go! Enjoy!
