# NBA Playoffs Simulation Project

Hello! Welcome to my NBA Playoffs Simulation Engine! In this simulation, you have the option of either simulation a whole NBA Playoff's with randomly generated teams, or generating a playoff series between any two teams in the NBA. Download the zip file and make sure you "pip3 install openpyxl", "pip3 install tabulate", "pip3 install random", and "pip3 install time" in the terminal. Then, simply run the code in the terminal and you're good to go! Enjoy!
